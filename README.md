# Regarding Comments
Most programs do not have comments. Normally I write many comments on my code,
but our programs were graded by a computer, and for some reason that made me
think I shouldn't add comments (which is wrong).

I will probably go back and either add a comment at the top describing the purpose
of each program, or give each program the full comment treatment if im not lazy.

Until then have fun guessing what each program is for...
